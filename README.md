Text based adventure game. The goal is to have fun building world(s) and sparking creation.

There are two kinds of code here. 

Objects.py, and Game.py are examples of code mean to be edited by a developer (but anyone is welcome).

Worlds.py is meant to be where people can create worlds through code and text. It should be simple enough to be a good place to learn.
